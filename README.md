Github Xcode Bot Builder
========================

A command line tool that creates/manages/deletes Xcode 5 server bots for each Github pull request. When a pull request is opened
a corresponding Xcode bot is created. When a new commit is pushed the bot is re-run. When the build finishes the github
pull request status is updated with a comment if there's an error. Users can request that a pull request be retested by
adding a comment that includes the word "retest" (case insensitive). When a pull request is closed the corresponding
bot is deleted.

Setup
=====
Make sure your Xcode server is correctly setup to allow ANYONE to create a build (without a username or password, see suggested features below).
Then make sure you can manually create and execute a build and run it.

Create a ~/.bot-sync-github.cfg

Go to your [Github Account Settings](https://github.com/settings/applications) and create a personal access token which
you will use as your *github_access_token* so that the **bot-sync-github** script can access your github repo.

Go to your [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#users), [create a user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsRuby/latest/DeveloperGuide/ruby-dg-setup.html) with put permission to a S3 bucket and generate an access key for the AWS API which will allow uploading builds for downloading.


```
github_access_token = 57244a72a7ca33931a40eb4ec21621505ab9f6b3
github_url = https://github.com/someuser/Some-Repo.git
github_repo = someuser/Some-Repo
xcode_server = 192.168.10.123
xcode_devices = iphonesimulator iPhone Retina (4-inch) 7.0|iphonesimulator iPhone Retina (4-inch) 6.1
xcode_scheme = Some-Scheme-Name-app
xcode_project_or_workspace = SomeProject.xcworkspace # or SomeProject.xcproject
aws_access_key_id = AWS access key id of S3 bucket for uploading builds
aws_access_secret_key = AWS access secret key of S3 bucket for uploading builds
```

Note that *xcode_devices* need to be pipe delimited. To get the list of available devices run the bot-devices command.
The *xcode_server* can either be an ip address or a hostname.

Manually run **bot-sync-github** from the command line to make sure it works

Schedule **bot-sync-github** to run in cron every couple of minutes. For example if you're using RVM:

```
*/2 * * * * $HOME/.rvm/bin/ruby-2.0.0-p247 $HOME/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p247/bin/bot-sync-github >> /tmp/bot-sync-github.log 2>&1
```

Contributing
============

* Github Xcode Bot Builder uses [Jeweler](https://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler) for managing the Gem, versioning,
  generating the Gemspec, etc. so do not manually edit the gemspec since it is auto generated from the Rakefile.
* Check out the latest **master** to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Don't forget to add yourself to the contributors section below
